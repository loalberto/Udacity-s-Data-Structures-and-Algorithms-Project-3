# Udacity-s-Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-Project-3
Basic algorithms that were completed in Udacity's Course.

Problem 1: Find the Square root of a given number
This problem required the student to create an algorithm, without using python libraries, 
that determines the square root of a number with a time complexity of O(logn)

Problem 2: Rotated Array
This problem required the student to create an algorithm that finds a number in a 
sorted array that gets rotated at a certain point. The algorithm is required to 
find this number in O(logn)

Problem 3: Rearrange Array Digits
This problem required the student to find two numbers that differ by 1 in digits and 
who's sum is the largest sum. This algorithm was required to preserve a time complexity 
of O(nlogn)

Problem 4: Dutch National Flag
This problem required the student to sort the array of digits, that had numbers [0, 1, 2], 
in a single traversal.

Problem 5: Autocomplete Tries
This problem required the student to create a Trie data structure that autocompletes a 
word for a user's typing.

Problem 6: Unsorted Integer Array
This problem required the student to find the min and max values of a array in a single traversal.

Problem 7: Request Routing
This problem required the student to utilize the Trie Data structure, created in problem 5, to create
a routing structure for paths. It requires the student to modify the Trie structure a bit so that it can store
handlers and more than single characters.
